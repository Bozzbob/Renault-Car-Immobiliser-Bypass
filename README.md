How to bypass a Renault car immobiliser using its bypass de-activation code For use with cars that have an infra-red key
#
What is it?
Some Renault cars have an inbuilt system that enables you to override the immobiliser should the infra-red key fob cease to work. This is useful to emergency and recovery services should they need to move a dead vehicle.
The Immobiliser Bypass Code is a four digit numeric code that is unique to each car. This code can be obtained by running a small downloadable Windows 32 bit software application and entering the specifics of your car.
This technique can only be used to override the immobiliser on a vehicle for which you have the key or key number so don't go thinking you can use this method to steal cars!
So, if you have found that the infra-red key fob for your Renault car is no longer de-activating the immobiliser, this bypass technique can be used as a temporary work around to start the car until you can get it fixed properly by a dealer.
